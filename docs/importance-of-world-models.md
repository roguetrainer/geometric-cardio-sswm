# World Models in the News - November 2025

Here is a breakdown of why Self-Supervised World Models (SSWMs) are in the news right now, and the role of Yann LeCun.

## 📢 Why SSWMs Are in the News (2025)

Self-Supervised World Models (or just "World Models") are in the news because the mainstream AI community is increasingly hitting a wall with current Large Language Models (LLMs) when it comes to true **reasoning, planning, and robotics**.

The core reasons SSWMs are trending now are:

1.  **The LLM "Dead End" Debate:** Pioneers like Yann LeCun argue that LLMs, which are primarily trained on text (a "low-bandwidth" signal), are a statistical tool for language but lack a true understanding of the physical world, gravity, causality, or "common sense." SSWMs are proposed as the next frontier precisely because they are designed to learn this physical understanding from high-bandwidth sensory data (video, motion, touch).
2.  **The Robotics and Embodied AI Boom:** Companies are investing heavily in humanoid and domestic robots, but these machines struggle with basic real-world tasks. LeCun and others argue that SSWMs—which can predict how the world changes based on an action—are the fundamental AI breakthrough needed to give robots the ability to **plan complex, zero-shot action sequences** (i.e., figure out how to do a new task without specific training).
3.  **Efficiency and Sample Complexity:** SSWMs, especially those using techniques like **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**, are theoretically much more **sample-efficient** than current generative models. They learn by predicting *abstract representations* of the future, rather than predicting every single pixel or token. This hints at massive reductions in the training data and compute required to achieve human-like learning efficiency.

## 🙋 The Yann LeCun Factor: A Major Advocate

**Yann LeCun is a staunch and very public advocate for World Models/SSWMs.** He is arguably the most prominent voice currently pushing this architectural shift.

### 1. Advocate for the Concept

LeCun, a Turing Award winner and one of the "Godfathers of Deep Learning," has spent years championing the idea that a human child learns its most fundamental knowledge (like physics and object permanence) through **self-supervised observation**, not labeled data.

* He views the development of an **internal world model** that can predict outcomes as the central missing piece for achieving human-level intelligence (AGI).
* His work at Meta focused on the **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**, a non-generative, self-supervised SSWM that aims to learn abstract representations of the world's dynamics.

### 2. The Meta Departure and Startup

His departure from Meta is directly tied to the SSWM story:

* **Departure Context:** While there were internal factors, LeCun's move to leave his Chief AI Scientist role at Meta (at the end of 2025) to start a new independent company is explicitly aimed at pursuing research on **"systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences."**
* **The Goal:** His new startup's mission is essentially to build the next generation of World Models, confirming that he views this approach as the only viable path to the next revolution in AI, moving away from Meta's immediate commercial focus on LLMs.

In short, LeCun's move has dramatically amplified the conversation around SSWMs, making them the central topic for anyone interested in the future of AGI and intelligent embodied agents.
