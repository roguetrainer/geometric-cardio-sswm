# Images Directory

This directory contains generated figures and visualizations from the Geometric Cardio SSWM project.

## Contents

Typical contents include:

- **training_curves.png**: Training loss curves over epochs
- **point_cloud_viz.png**: 3D visualizations of cardiac point clouds
- **fiber_orientations.png**: Fiber architecture visualizations  
- **latent_space.png**: PCA/t-SNE projections of learned latent space
- **strain_heatmaps.png**: Spatial distribution of strain invariants
- **prediction_comparison.png**: True vs predicted observations
- **geodesic_paths.png**: Visualization of geodesic interpolation
- **architecture_diagram.png**: Model architecture schematic

## Generation

Images are automatically generated by:
- Running Jupyter notebooks in `../notebooks/`
- Training scripts that include visualization callbacks
- The visualization utilities in `../src/visualization.py`

## Usage

These images can be:
- Included in research presentations
- Used in documentation and papers
- Shared for collaborative discussions
- Analyzed to understand model behavior
